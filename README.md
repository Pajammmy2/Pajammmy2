### What I'm building

- 🎟️ **[Had To Be There](https://had-to-be-there-18cd7.web.app/)**  
  Web app for sharing “you had to be there” moments with friends.  
  - Built with a small team, focusing on real users, iteration, and learning from shipping.  
  - Uses a Firebase backend and a simple but extensible front-end architecture.

- 🎮 **Jumpydoodle**  
  Small Java game exploring game loops, collision logic, and state management.  
  - Good example of my early Java work and how I think about structure in a tiny codebase.

More projects are in progress — I’m actively building out my GitHub with coursework, side projects, and experiments.
